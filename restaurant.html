                    If you love spicy food, then you are certainly in paradise! This is because Sri Lankan cuisine is instilled with the generous use of chillies in most of their dishes. Sri Lankans use chillies in many different forms, powdered, dried, fresh and there is even a flaky version of it.
Pro tip: If you do not enjoy the heat, you can dowse down the spiciness with a yoghurt drink which is readily available at almost all eateries across the island.</p>
